I used this webiste to be able to download the current project and store a copy of it on my own machine and my own Git Hub repository.

This website gave me the instructions on how to start up the website locally, I did run into a few issues, I needed to avoid installing a new webapp,
I also needed to make sure to change my directory to the correct website. I also ran into some issues with the certification, if you follow the instructions
you should be fine, but if not, try using "dotnet dev-certs https --clear" and then use the cert command again "dotnet dev-certs https --trust"
